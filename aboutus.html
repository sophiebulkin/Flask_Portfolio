          <h5>Hello everyone! My name is Mustafa Sharaf, I'm in 11th grade, and I go to Del Norte High School! This is my first time taking a coding class, besides taking coding classes in boot camps. I love learning about new types of code that makes code run faster. My favorite project has been the Rap Name Generator, it was fun to experiment with different types of code in order to display the options in the sub menus. </h5>
          <h5>Contribution to the Flask Portfolio project:I have created and finished a new README.md file for the project,I have organized and cut down the code, and I will work on the comments in the code for users to get a better understanding of code.</h5>

          <h5>Hi! My name is Sophie Bulkin and I'm a junior at Del Norte High School! In these past two years, I have been in Mr.M's class learning about computer science and I can confidently say that I have learned a lot. I am so excited for the future of this class and the upcoming projects that we will work on! My favorite project so far has been the rap game project becasue I feel like we had a lot of freedom to choose what we did with our code in this project.</h5>   
          <h5>Contribution to the Flask Portfolio project: My main contribution was the about us page. i figured out how to add pictures and organize this aspect of our project. I also helped with the main file and fugring out what to do when our dropdown button werent working.</h5>

I also love math and science, and now computer science with Mr.M. I am starting to learn a lot and I am becoming excited to code. I can't wait to learn so much more in the future.</h5> 
          <h5>Contribution to the Flask Portfolio project: I worked on the navbar and the app routes for the different links within our html project. At first this seemed like a tough task but with some help I was able to complete it.</h5>

          <h5>Hello! I am Aditi and I am a Junior at Del Norte. I love animals, travel, and science. This is my first year in Mr. M's class and I am learning so much about Python and html files! I look forward to learning more about computers and programming</h5> <h5>Contribution to the Flask Portfolio project: I created the about us page and formatted it. Along with Carter, I created a Navbar and added all the links. I also formatted the home page and added all the links to the projects, repl.its and resources.</h5>

          <h5>Hello! I am Isai and I am an eleventh grader at Del Norte. I love reading, watching tv, and dance. This is my first time learning anything regarding Computer Science and it has been a very fun experience. I have learned different types of coding from basic Python fundamentals to .html. I hope to further improve from here.</h5>  
          <h5>Contribution to the Flask Portfolio project: I experimented a lot with how to add backgrounds. At first, I thought we could use ascii art for the background. However, I realized that .html tries to conserve as much space as possible so this wasn't a viable option. I inserted an image at the top of the website that fitted the aesthetics of the website and sized it to fit correctly. I also added a file "Contents of Our Website" that outlines everything in the website for users.</h5>
